1. File a bug at https://github.com/nicolasgarnier/drive-music-player/issues (if there isn’t one already). If your patch is going to be large it might be a good idea to get the discussion started early. We are happy to discuss it in a new issue beforehand.
1. Make sure that patches provide justification for why they should be merged. Music Player for Google Drive is an opinionated project and as such, patches which add support for alternative choices to those we prescribe are not guaranteed to land.

1. We ask that you squash all the commits together before pushing.
